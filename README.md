# The Punished

The Punished is a 2D game that I began developing back in high school. I have decided to come back to this project, redesign some things as well as use libraries to accomplish some of the things I wanted to do.

The Slick2D libray is being used at the moment.

# Story:

The Gods have punished you. For what, you do not know. However, you do know that you are stuck in this place. Wherever this place is. You know not the name of the place, the name of this world, or even your own name. You have but one quest: Discover your path, and answer the questions left unanswered by the Gods, For a great story is about to unfold.
